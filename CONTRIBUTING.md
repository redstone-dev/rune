# Contributing to Rune
Sorry, nope, you can't.

**JUST KIDDING!** Simply make a commit **in a new branch**. 

This is **extremely important** because if you don't, you might end up creating an unwanted commit that won't go so well.

Then, [make a PR](https://github.com/redstone2010/rune/pulls) describing what you changed and we might add it.

You can also help with bug reporting. To submit bugs, simply [submit an issue](https://github.com/redstone2010/rune/issues) and put **`[BUG]`** in the title before any other word.
